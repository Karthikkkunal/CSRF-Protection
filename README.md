# **CSRF Protection**

This repository provides an implementation of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection using **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and other technologies. The project demonstrates how to secure sensitive actions from unauthorized or malicious cross-origin requests by leveraging CSRF tokens and best practices.

---

## **Features**
- Implements **CSRF token generation** and validation for enhanced web security.
- Example code using **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** for backend and frontend integration.
- Clear implementation of form protection using tokens.
- Lightweight and easy-to-integrate solution for web developers.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Backend Frameworks**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Frontend Tools**: HTML Forms  
- **Other Tools**: Git, NPM

---

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (Version 14 or later)
- **NPM** (Node Package Manager)
- **Git**

---

### **Steps to Clone the Repository**
1. Open your terminal and clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karthikkkunal/CSRF-Protection.git
   cd CSRF-Protection
   ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate project directory:
   - For the **TypeScript Example**:
     ```bash
     cd TypeScript-CSRF
     ```
   - For the **JavaScript Example**:
     ```bash
     cd JavaScript-CSRF
     ```

---

## **TypeScript Example**

### **Installation**
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### **Run the Application**
1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Access the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. Test the CSRF token validation by submitting the sample form provided.

---

## **JavaScript Example**

### **Installation**
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### **Run the Application**
1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

2. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. Test the CSRF protection mechanism by submitting the form.

## **How CSRF Protection Works**
1. **CSRF Token Generation**:  
   - A unique token is generated on the server side and sent to the client.
   - The token is embedded in HTML forms or included as a custom HTTP header in AJAX requests.

2. **CSRF Token Validation**:  
   - The server compares the received token with the one stored in the user's session or database.
   - Requests with missing or invalid tokens are rejected, ensuring security.

3. **Headers and Same-Site Cookies**:  
   - In addition to token-based protection, the project enforces security using `SameSite` cookies to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.

---

## **Usage**
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the desired project directory.
2. Follow the setup steps to install dependencies and run the application.
3. Test the CSRF protection by interacting with the provided example forms.

---

## **Project Structure**
- **`TypeScript-CSRF/`**: Contains the TypeScript-based implementation.
- **`JavaScript-CSRF/`**: Contains the JavaScript-based implementation.
- **`public/`**: Includes HTML and CSS files for the frontend.

---

## **Skills Demonstrated**
