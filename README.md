# CSRF-Protection

# What It Is : 
CSRF tokens are unique, unpredictable values that are generated by the server and tied to user sessions.

# How It Works : 
Include the token in every form submission or sensitive request. The server validates the token to ensure the request originated from the legitimate user.

# Summary : 
To implement CSRF protection, always use CSRF tokens, validate request headers, restrict cookies using SameSite, and follow secure development practices like avoiding sensitive GET requests and leveraging framework-level security features.
